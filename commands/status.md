  Read-only snapshot of the whole Muster pipeline — open specs, every task
  bucketed by state, open PRs, recent activity, and a prioritised "what to do
  next". Run any time to reorient. Reads only; changes nothing.

# Status

Print where this project stands right now and what to do next. This command is
strictly read-only: it fetches issues, PRs, and git state and reports them. It
never changes a label, comment, branch, or file.

## Step 1 — Preconditions

- `gh auth status` — if not authenticated, print "Run: gh auth login" and stop.
- Read `CONTEXT.md` if it exists (for the base branch and domain vocabulary).

## Step 2 — Gather

Fetch in parallel where possible:

```bash
gh issue list --label spec  --state open --json number,title,labels
gh issue list --label task  --state all  --json number,title,labels,updatedAt
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName,labels
git log --oneline -10
```

## Step 3 — Bucket the tasks

Sort each task into exactly one bucket by its state label. A task with no state
label sits in "awaiting triage". Within each bucket, oldest first.

- **Awaiting triage** — `ready` without `agent-ready`/`needs-human-input`, or no state label
- **Agent-ready** — `agent-ready` (show the `risk:*` label)
- **Needs human input** — `needs-human-input`
- **Needs info** — `needs-info`
- **In review** — `in-review` (link the open PR)
- **Needs work** — `needs-work`
- **On hold** — `on-hold`
- **Blocked** — `blocked`
- **Done** — closed in the last 7 days

## Step 4 — Print the snapshot

```
MUSTER STATUS

Specs (open):
  #[N]  [title]  —  [X tasks: Y done, Z open]

Pipeline:
  Awaiting triage    ([n])  #[N] [title]
  Agent-ready        ([n])  #[N] risk:[risk] [title]
  Needs human input  ([n])  #[N] [title]
  Needs info         ([n])  #[N] [title]
  In review          ([n])  #[N] [title]  (PR #[P])
  Needs work         ([n])  #[N] [title]
  On hold            ([n])  #[N] [title]
  Blocked            ([n])  #[N] [title]
  Done (7d)          ([n])  #[N] [title]

Open PRs:
  PR #[P]  [title]  ([branch])  —  awaiting your merge

Recent commits on [base]:
  [git log --oneline -10]

Next:
  [Prioritised, concrete actions — see below.]
```

## Step 5 — Prioritise "Next"

Recommend the highest-leverage action, in this order:

1. Open PRs waiting on you → "Merge PR #P (or run /review P first)."
2. `agent-ready` tasks with nothing in review → "Run /build."
3. `ready`/untriaged tasks → "Run /triage."
4. `needs-info`/`needs-human-input` → name what you owe each one.
5. `needs-work`/`blocked` → "Fix and re-label `ready`, then /triage."
6. No open specs at all → "Run /think then /spec to start something."

Give the one or two actions that matter most, not the whole list.

## Rules

- Read-only. Never change a label, comment, branch, PR, or file.
- Every task appears in exactly one bucket.
- If `gh` is unauthenticated, stop after the precondition check.
